    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several americans love to have a good cup of joe in the morning. Coffee
      is the fuel of us americans; it is the reason we are able to function in
      the morning.<br/> But why is it that we are so hooked on this smooth brown drink.
      Well believe or not, coffee is similar to a drug. Coffee is very addicting, mainly
      because of the caffeine it contains.</p>
