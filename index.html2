  <h1>Caffeine Withdrawal</h1>
  <img src="Images/download8.jpeg">
<p>Like previously said, caffeine is similar to a drug, you body gets hooked on it. When a person a stops taking a drug they have 
been using, they suffer from severe symptoms.<br/>These symptoms are a part of withdrawal. Since caffeine is similar to a drug, an 
individual will go through caffeine withdrawal if they stop injesting caffeine. Luckily, the symptoms are more minor than the 
symptoms you get from real drugs, i.e. vommiting. Below is a list of possible caffeine withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<ul>
        <li>Headaches</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Anxiety</li>
        <li>Irritability</li>
        <li>Decreased concentration</li>
        <li>Tremors (only occurs if you are extremely dependent on caffeine)</li>
      </ul>

<h2>Low-Caffeine Coffees</h2>

<p>Sometimes it is too hard for people to completely quit caffeine. An alternative to quitting is to lower the amount caffeine in 
your coffee. Doing this will still let you<br/> have some caffeine, but a healthy amoount. Perhaps, you could kill your caffeine 
if you keep lowering the doeses of caffeine. In order to do this process, I have provided a table with low-caffine coffees.</p>
